# Desktop-Only Restaurant Website

⚠️ **Warning:** This project is intentionally desktop-only. The layout will break on mobile screens. Use a desktop or a wide browser window for the intended experience.

## About
A simple restaurant landing site built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Designed and tested for desktop (large screen) use. Mobile responsiveness hasn't been implemented, and small screens will likely look broken.
